Hi, I'm a software engineer interested in Kubernetes and other cloud-native technologies.
I am currently working as an SRE at Quipper, Ltd.

I want to make use of the experience I gained on the job to contribute to other companies.
If your company has any problems or questions about Kubernetes, please contact us!
